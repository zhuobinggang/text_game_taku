The dinner is almost ready! It's only missing a grilled half of a bag of chips.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You begin looking for
stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer.
You can make out an antique trunk. You rest your hand against a wall, but you
miss the wall and fall onto a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. The
king-size bed appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.
